- I achieved the following requirements: included title, header, horizontal navigation bar, body, p, h1, h2, buttons, footer with copyright sections, video links, a background image, an image, I used flex box to position the image to the left, cursor and a bottom to top side bar.
- Some requirements I was unable to achieve were:
- What I found difficult about these tasks was: use of buttons with links and styling navigation section.
- I would like to request feedback about my use of buttons for my website.
- Websites such as W3 Schools giving information about CSS  were useful for me when developing my website.
- Some errors I encountered were: use of buttons with links.
- What went really well was including a background image in my website and designing color, font and style of my text.
- What could have gone better was: use of buttons with links.
