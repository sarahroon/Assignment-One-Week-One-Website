- I achieved the following requirements: title, header, body, p, h1, h2, buttons, footer with copyright sections, video links, a background image, an image, I used flex box to position the image to the left.
- Some requirements I was unable to achieve were: positioning some of the text.
- What I found difficult about these tasks was: positioning some elements and creating a scroll bar.
- I would like to request feedback about the use of buttons for my website such as how to make use of the Top button to help the user navigate to the top of the web page.
- Websites such as W3 Schools giving information about CSS  were useful for me when developing my website.
- Some errors I encountered were: use of buttons navigating to sections of my website.
- What went really well was I included an extra feature, a top button and a marquee with a welcome message for users coming my websites which invites more users to use my website.
- What could have gone better was: use of buttons with links.
