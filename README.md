I achieved the following requirements: included title, header, horizontal navigation bar, body, p, h1, h2, buttons, footer with copyright sections, video links and a background image.
Some requirements I was unable to achieve were:
What I found difficult about these tasks was: use of buttons with links and styling navigation section.
I would like to request feedback about my use of buttons for my website.
Websites about CSS styles were useful for me when developing my website.
Some errors I encountered were: use of buttons with links.
What went really well was including a background image in my website and designing color, font and style of my text.
What could have gone better was: use of buttons with links.
